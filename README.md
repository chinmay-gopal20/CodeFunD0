Natural Disaster - Wild Fire
	One of the Natures Disaster that seldom happens but once it is there it leads to a enormous amount of economical loss sometime lives.

CAUSE:
	There are several cause for Wild Fire by nature and humans, humans rarely. 

What we do:
	Since nature is the superior of all, it's something unreachable for us humans to know when the superior strikes. But suerly we can able to manage it's vigour. Even a small spark can make a millions into ashes.
	Here, TEAM 28 is focusing on how we can manage the resources and requirements when superior strikes. Suppose there is a wild fire in  the middle of a forest of 50 kms radius. How do the rescue people know? How soon they know? What if they don't even know for some time? Yes, you're right it's done.
	We surveillance the whole forest by a centralised hub for 24/7, we will use some mechanisams to inform the rescue and also we will have some techniques to control the fire untill rescue peoples come. It will also provide the intensity of the fire i.e) we will predict the direction it moves and how much time it will take, where to start first, how many teams they need to stop this, what all ways they can stop and some guidance for the resuce peoles. So that they get the clear idea about the fire and execute in manner.
